        Print making is currently my most prevalent hobby, as it is one that is
        easy to continue while on the go. I can take a block, or linoleum sheet,
        with me in my bag and continue to carve if I have down time during the
        day.

        While making and carving blocks is fun and easy to bring along, actually
        printing the block is a different story. I usually use oil based ink,
        which tends to be messy and thick, meaning clean up can be extensive.
        Due to these issues, it's better to print in a spacious area that is
        well ventilated.
